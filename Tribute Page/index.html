            <h3>About Kazi Nazrul Islam</h3>
            <p>Kazi Nazrul Islam, known as the “Rebel Poet,” became famous for his poem Bidrohi (The Rebel). His
                patriotic poems and songs inspired people during the British rule and the Bangladesh Liberation War in
                1971. Many consider him the strongest Bengali poet after Rabindranath Tagore. His writing spoke against
                oppression, religious and social hatred, and injustice, so the British banned some of his works.

                Nazrul also wrote nearly 3,000 songs and composed their music. His love songs became very popular and
                are still admired today. His works reflect his own life—his poor childhood, strong patriotism, and
                free-spirited lifestyle.</p>
